## üöÄ Overview
**Async Video Downloader** is a lightweight, high-performance tool for downloading videos from **Instagram** and **Facebook**.  
It combines a **console-based async engine** (using `aiohttp` and `asyncio`) with a **Flask-based web interface** for managing downloads easily through your browser.

This project is built to handle **multiple downloads concurrently**, retry failed tasks, and track progress in real time ‚Äî all while using minimal system resources.

‚úÖ **Web Dashboard:** Flask server to manage and view tasks  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS  
‚úÖ **Concurrent Downloads:** Configure max downloads and retry limits  
‚úÖ **Auto Dependency Installation:** Missing packages are automatically installed

[ Flask Web Server ] <--> [ Async Downloader Core ]
‚Üë ‚Üì
Browser UI aiohttp + asyncio

- **Flask** handles the frontend UI and API endpoints.  
- **aiohttp** manages async HTTP sessions for downloading.  
- **Threading + asyncio loop** ensures responsiveness and high throughput.
